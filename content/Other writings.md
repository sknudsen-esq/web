>«Significant literary effectiveness can come into being only in a strict alternation between action and writing; it must nurture the inconspicuous forms that fit its influence in active communities better than does the pretentious, universal gesture of the book — in leaflets, brochures, articles and placards. Only this prompt language shows itself actively equal to the moment.»
>—Walter Benjamin, _One-Way Street_.
